To provide a rough estimate, smaller electric heat treatment furnaces with a power rating of around 10 kW to 50 kW may have an average power consumption in the range of 5 kWh to 50 kWh per hour, depending on the specific heat treatment process and the desired temperature. Larger furnaces with higher power ratings can consume significantly more power.

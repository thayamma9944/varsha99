A watchdog, in the context of computer systems and microcontrollers, refers to a mechanism or circuit designed to monitor the operation of a system and take action if it detects a malfunction or failure. The primary purpose of a watchdog is to ensure the system's reliability and stability by automatically recovering from or alerting about abnormal conditions. Here's how a watchdog typically works:

Monitoring: The watchdog circuit continuously monitors the system's operation, typically by looking for periodic "heartbeat" signals. These signals are generated by the system's software or firmware at regular intervals, indicating that the system is functioning correctly.

Timer: The watchdog circuit includes a timer that starts counting when it receives the heartbeat signal. If the timer reaches a certain threshold before receiving the next heartbeat signal, it indicates that the system has stopped responding or encountered an issue.

Reset or Action: When the watchdog timer expires, it triggers a specific action. The action can vary depending on the system's design and requirements. Common actions include generating a system reset, initiating a recovery procedure, or activating an alarm or fault indication.

System Recovery: In many cases, the action triggered by the watchdog timer is a system reset. This resets the system, allowing it to restart and resume normal operation. The reset can help recover from software glitches, hangs, or other failures that prevent the system from functioning properly.

Software Interaction: The system's software or firmware is responsible for periodically resetting the watchdog timer by sending heartbeat signals. This ensures that the watchdog does not trigger unwanted actions when the system is operating correctly. If the software or firmware encounters a problem and fails to reset the watchdog timer, the watchdog will take appropriate action.

Watchdogs are commonly used in safety-critical systems, embedded systems, and real-time applications where system failures can have serious consequences. They help ensure that the system remains operational and respond to any failures or abnormal conditions promptly.
